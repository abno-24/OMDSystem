# OMDSystem

Hello this is Abhinav Maurya here and this my final year project, I have build this project to help poor and needy people.

you might have noticed that sometimes we have expired or unused medicine at our home but major of the time what we do ?

we just throw it in trash... which we should not do.

with the help of my website anyone can donate unused or even expired medicine to the nearby NGO.

NGO will collect medicine from user and if it is unused medicine then NGO will donate it to the Government hospital so the poor people can get medicine as per the need,
but if is expired medicine then NGO will give it to the pharmaceutical company for its proper disposal.

I have build this project on ASP.net framework and used HTML, CSS, Bootstrap and C# for develop frontend and SQL Server for the backend.
